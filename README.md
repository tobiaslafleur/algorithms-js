# Algorithms-js
This is a hobby project of mine that started after taking the course Datastructures and Algorithms. The application gives a visual representation of some of the different ways to search in a graph.

The application creates a grid where the four adjacent nodes are connected with an edge. With the exception of nodes that appear on the edge, these only have the nodes that exist in the grid added as an edge. 

As an example the node at the top left position has a edge to the node that is south of it, and the node that is north of it. While a node in the middle of the grid will have edjes to all four adjacent nodes.
